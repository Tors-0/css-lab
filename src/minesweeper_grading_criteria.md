 - functional decomposition
 - looping with repetition control structures
 - nested loops
     - it's hard to tell where these are at first glance, but there are method calls inside loops that themselves contain loops
 - branching with selection control structures
 - file i/o
   - found in the revealBoardOnGameOver() method
 - one dimensional arrays
   - there are several
 - multidimensional arrays
   - these exist for no reason, I miscounted how many criteria I had and turned several one dimensional arrays into a multidimensional array for no reason
